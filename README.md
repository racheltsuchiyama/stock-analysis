# stock-analysis

In order to make informed decisions for trading stocks, I created a macro in VBA to find the number of trades and returns for each stock. The number of trades per day, or the total daily volume, helps us gauge the accuracy of the stock price. The actual value of the stock converges with the stock price as the frequency of trades increase. The returns represent the percentage increase or decrease of the price at the end of the year compared to the beginning of the year. With these two values, we can wisely choose which stocks to invest in.
